[`cargo-generate`] is a developer tool to help you get up and
running quickly with a new Rust project by leveraging a
pre-existing git repository as a template.

I really enjoy the use of [`just`] in this template. There is a ton
of goodies from here I want to incorporate into my own personal
setup.
